			Marcellus is my pseudonym, for obvious reasons I won't be giving my real name.<br>
			I'm usually not that good at talking about myself, but for once I would like to make an effort. I'm a IT student at EPITA, musician since my childhood, big brother, and that's about it (I believe so). I had the idea of making this little website while watching a school friend's projects, <a class="text-link" href="https://ratakor.com">Ratakor</a>, who's taught me a lot of things about libre and open source systems. He's kind of like a mentor to me, although we are in the same class.
			I hope you enjoy taking a look at my website, have a good day !
